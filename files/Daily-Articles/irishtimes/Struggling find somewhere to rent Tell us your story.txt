Are you fed up hearing about landlords accepting cash-in-hand deposits during viewings before letting everyone in to see the place?

The latest statistics from the Daft.ie property website show that rents across have increased by almost 12 per cent year-on-year to June, meaning thousands of people across the whole country are being priced out of the rental market.

In Dublin it now costs almost €3,000 a year more to rent while it is €1,500 a year more outside the capital and there is little sign that this increase will slow down any time soon.

This means the average rent between April-June this year rose to €1,159 a month, a payment many working adults in this country will struggle to meet.

Meanwhile, the number of houses and apartments available to rent is continuing to shrink with 20 per cent fewer properties available.
