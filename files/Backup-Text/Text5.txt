COMEDIAN Jason Byrne has appeared in court accused of driving without a driving licence.
Mr Byrne (45) was allegedly stopped by traffic gardai near his home at Oldtown, Co Dublin last week.
The accused appeared before Swords District Court this morning charged with driving without a driving licence at the R122 Oldtown on June 13 last.
Judge Conal Gibbons adjourned the case to a date in September.
A garda witness gave evidence that he arrested Mr Byrne at 3.10pm on June 13 last. He was taken to Swords Garda Station where he was charged at 4.03pm. The accused was handed a true copy of the charge sheet and he made no reply to the charge after caution.
The court heard that Mr Byrne is facing the possibility of further charges.
Defence lawyer Patrick Jackson said he was instructed by solicitor Laura Shannon.
Mr Jackson said there was consent to a date in September.
Judge Gibbons adjourned the case to September 12.
"That's perfect", said Mr Jackson.
Wearing a black t-shirt and wine bomber jacket, a bearded Mr Byrne did not address the court during the short hearing.
Mr Byrne has not yet indicated how he is pleading to the charge.
The funnyman, with an address in Oldtown, Co Dublin, is due to play a series of gigs next month in Howth, Bray, Waterford, Cork and Dundalk.
