AN ISIS terror suspect being deported on an Aer Lingus flight yesterday terrified passengers as he screamed: “I can’t go back. I’m not a criminal!”
The Algerian man, who was arrested by gardai on suspicion of being involved in terrorism, was kicked out of the country this week.
He was put on board a packed flight to Frankfurt, Germany, early yesterday morning accompanied by a four-man Garda team.
Shocked eyewitnesses told how the man caused a major scene as he was led on board the plane, screaming obscenities and terrifying small children.
One young family, who asked to remain anonymous, was left traumatised by the ordeal.
The father told the Irish Sun: “We were on the plane settling in and the captain made an announcement explaining that there would be gardai escorting a man onto the plane and that we weren’t to be worried, that this happens regularly.
“I just assumed it was someone who had been living in the country illegally.
“The captain also warned that the man would be resisting and making a scene but that he would calm down eventually. Next thing four gardai lead this guy on and he was screaming his head off.
“It was very distressing and there were terrified kids crying.
“He was roaring in broken English, saying, ‘I can’t go back, I need my lawyer’, things like that.
“He also yelled that he had a wife and kept saying he wasn’t a criminal. We were sitting a few rows ahead of him and my son was very upset.”
