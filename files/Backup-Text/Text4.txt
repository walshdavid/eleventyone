The 80-year-old pontiff may visit the country for the World Meeting of Families in Dublin from August 21 to 26, 2018.And according to Independent.ie, the GAA are open to hosting a papal mass at Croke Park.
The clash has been held on the third Sunday of August for the last number of years.
August 26 is the draft date for the game – but it will be pushed back to September 2 if the venue is confirmed.
Central Council delegates are understood to have agreed to this in principle.
In March, senior Vatican official Cardinal Kevin Farrell told journalists Francis “will do everything he can”.
The last gathering of its kind, in Philadelphia in 2015, was also addressed by Francis, who has made family life one of the central themes of his papacy.
Francis will be the first pope to visit Ireland since John Paul II in 1979.
Former Taoiseach Enda Kenny ruffled feathers by announcing the pope’s plans to visit after an audience at the Vatican in November, at which point the Holy See had not even confirmed any of the pontiff’s 2017 travel plans.
