Misbehaving tourists in Magaluf could be fined up to €3,000 if they fall foul of an extensive set of rules unveiled by the local council this week.
A long list of banned activities in the Mallorca resort best known for alcohol-fuelled debauchery includes the obvious (urinating, spitting, and being naked on the streets), as well as the more unusual (climbing trees and using soap in public showers, to name but a couple).
The measures, which were initially approved last year by the town hall of Calvia (the region of the island that includes Magaluf and Palmanova), are the latest attempt to crack down on bad behaviour among tourists and clean up the image of Magaluf.
There has even been talk of transforming it into an upmarket, family-friendly destination.
he fines range from €100 to €599 for “minor” offences, including throwing cigarette butts or shining a laser beam on the streets, to more “serious” misdemeanours, for which the fine is €600 to €1,499 and “very serious” violations, including serving alcoholic drinks to those under the age of 18, where which will incur fines ranging from €1,500 to €3,000.
Local bars and cafes can also face fines for serving alcohol to those who are already drunk, or serving drinks or food to be consumed on the street, while owners must “ensure good order” and event organisers “must guarantee people’s safety”.
