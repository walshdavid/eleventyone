The husband of an American woman who died in a cycling accident 
while holidaying in Kerry has paid tribute to the people of
 Killarney and local gardaí in a touching letter.
Don Theiler was holidaying in Ireland with his wife Janet in 
May when she was killed in a tragic accident while cycling.
In his poignant letter to the people of Killarney he recounted
 the moment the couple's vacation ended in tragedy.
"We were concluding our trip and arrived in Killarney on the
 evening of May 29 with a day to spend in Killarney before
 departing for the United States early on the morning of the 31st," he wrote.
"We decided to rent bikes on the 30th and see the sites on 
the lakes in Killarney National Park and the Dunloe Gap," he writes.
"All was going well until Janet rounded and extremely sharp 
turn on the very narrow road in Dunloe Gap and struck a trailer full of lambs being pulled by a truck.
"She was killed during the accident."
In the aftermath of Janet's untimely death Mr Theiler 
said the response from locals and from gardaí went above and beyond his expectations.
"You were there at the worst moment in my life and helped 
ease the pain in extraordinary ways, most especially with the selfless help of some wonderful people," he said.
