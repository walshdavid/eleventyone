An 11-year-old schoolboy, who had to have 25 stitches inserted in a gash on his leg, has been awarded €44,000 damages against Dublin City Council.
Barrister Fergus O’Higgins told the Circuit Civil Court today Tuesday that Nojus Baltrimus had been playing “hide and seek” in a local authority garden and caught his leg on an exposed screw.
Mr O’Higgins, who appeared with Cosgrove Gaynard Solicitors, said Nojus lived in a city council apartment in Liberty Court, Lower Clanbrassil Street, Dublin.
On 15 June 2014 he had been playing with friends in the communal garden area of the Mercer Street Apartments and had hidden himself behind a water cylinder.
Mr O’Higgins told Circuit Court President, Mr Justice Raymond Groarke, that when emerging from his hiding place Nojus, now aged 14, caught his shin on the pointed end of an exposed metal screw jutting out from the water tank structure.
“He suffered a very serious laceration to his right shin and had to have 25 stitches inserted in the wound,” Mr O’Higgins told the court.
He said Nojus had been taken to Crumlin Childrens’ Hospital where the stitches were inserted. He had attended his GP two weeks later to have the stitches removed but only half could be taken out because of an infection for which he had been prescribed antibiotics.
