The Duke of Cambridge is celebrating his 35th birthday.
William, who attended Royal Ascot with the Duchess of Cambridge on Tuesday, is expected to spend the day privately with Kate and their children Prince George and Princess Charlotte.
This year, the Duke is making some major changes to his life by becoming a full-time royal.
He is due to finish his job as an air ambulance helicopter pilot later in the summer as the Cambridges leave the countryside for a life in the city.
With Prince George starting school in London in September, their main home will be Kensington Palace, but Anmer Hall, the family's 10-bedroom mansion in Norfolk, will still be used for weekend retreats.
William will be joining the royals in stepping up to his assist his grandmother the Queen when the Duke of Edinburgh retires from public duties in the autumn.
Next month, the Duke and Duchess will pay a five-day official visit to Poland and Germany - visiting Warsaw and Hamburg.
The trip - at the request of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office - is being seen as another Brexit diplomacy tour by the royals, to help improve the UK's relations with Europe as it leaves the EU.
William and Kate dated for more than eight years before marrying at Westminster Abbey in July 2011. William was made the Duke of Cambridge by the Queen on the morning of his wedding.
