Jose Mourinho still sees Alvaro Morata as the man to replace
 Zlatan Ibrahimovic as Manchester United intensify their
 pursuit of the Real Madrid forward, despite an £80m price tag.
The player is understood to be keen on a Premier League move
 and if United CEO Ed Woodward can negotiate a transfer fee
 with Real, our colleagues at Sky in Italy understand personal
 terms will not be a sticking point.
Reports in Spain say Morata's agent Juanma Lopez held talks
 at the Bernabeu on Wednesday to try to negotiate the player's departure.
Standing in the way is Real's £80m demand for the player who 
scored 19 goals in 43 appearances last season.
His coach Zinedine Zidane wants the former Juventus striker 
to stay but the player is desperate for more game time, 
which the Frenchman can't guarantee.
United have been in talks with the La Liga champions over
 Morata for several weeks and Sky in Italy reported on June 9 they had seen a £52.4m offer rejected with Madrid understood to be holding out for close to £78m. Morata's representative Juanma Lopez also revealed earlier this month that Real had rejected an offer from AC Milan.
